    <h2>A recent trip</h2>
    <p>
      During laber day, our family visited Turkey Run State Park in Indiana.
      Turkey Run features 11 different hiking trails, and its Trail No. 3 has
      been named the best hike in the Midwest. We hiked the trails, enjoyed the
      beautiful scenery. It was a great way to spend quality time together and
      appreciate nature.

      <h2>My favorite restaurant and food</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://shapiros.com" target="_blank">Shapiro’s Delicatessen</a
        >, established in 1934, is my favorite restaurant in Indiana. Known for
        its rich history and warm, welcoming atmosphere, it offers an authentic
        New York–style deli experience right in the Midwest. The food is
        consistently top-quality, from freshly baked rye bread to house-made
        pickles, and every bite feels steeped in tradition. Their classic corned
        beef sandwich, stacked high and perfectly seasoned, is absolutely
        outstanding and keeps me coming back every time.

            >Shapiro’s Delicatessen</a
          >
          is the Pastrami Sandwich. It begins with a tender beef navel,
          slow-smoked with a special blend of secret spices and rub, then sliced
          hot to order. Each sandwich is piled high with about six ounces of
          perfectly seasoned pastrami and served on Shapiro’s famous rye
          bread—or any bread you prefer. The result is a hearty, two-handed meal
          that’s as satisfying as it is unforgettable.

              A startling and haunting vision of the world, 1984 is so powerful
              that it is completely convincing from start to finish. No one can
              deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or
              the power of its admonitions—a legacy that seems only to grow with
              the passage of time.
